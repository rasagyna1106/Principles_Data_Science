# Question 2 — Student Performance: Visualization Report

Figures are saved in **`reports/figures/`** (800×600 px, 300 DPI). Interpretations for each figure (5–8 sentences each).

## V1 — Gender split for Math vs Reading (boxplots)

**Chart:** Side-by-side boxplots of math score and reading score grouped by gender.

**Interpretation:**

From the box plots, the performance of male and female students is indicated in terms of mathematics and reading scores. It is noticeable that the performance of female students is slightly higher in reading, with a small lead in mathematics scores by male students. It is noticeable that there is some overlapping of scores in the performance of the two groups of students, indicating that performance is not sharply divided. By looking at the data, there are some scores that act as outliers in the performance of this group of students.

## V2 — Effect of test prep on Math scores (boxplots)

**Chart:** Boxplot of math score by test preparation course (completed vs none).

**Interpretation:**

It is evident from the box plots that the students who had test preparation scored higher in math. It is observed that the median of the scores of prepared students is higher than those of the students who did not get any preparation. Prepared students lack student scores that fall in the range of the lowest values. It is observed that the students who did not receive any preparation had scores spread across a wide range of values.

## V3 — Lunch type vs average score (bar chart)

**Chart:** Grouped bar chart of mean overall average (math, reading, writing) by lunch type.

**Interpretation:**

A bar chart shows the performance of students depending on lunch offered. Standard lunch students' performance is higher than that of free/reduced lunch students. This data implies that economic influences could be affecting student performance. Performance is equal across subjects. Free/reduced lunch students could be getting less support, hence having lower scores. Standard lunch students perform better in academics.

## V4 — Math, Reading, Writing correlation (heatmap)

**Chart:** Correlation heatmap for math, reading, and writing with annotated coefficients.

**Interpretation:**

From the heatmap, there appear to be positive correlations between math, reading, and writing skills. It is evident that reading skills are the most correlated with writing skills, indicating that students who perform well in one subject, particularly reading, are likely to perform well in writing as well. Math skills appear to be well correlated with both reading and writing skills, indicating that students who perform well in math are likely to perform well in both reading and writing as well. It is evident that the heatmap suggests that skills in one subject can help in improving performance in other subjects as well.

## V5 — Math vs Reading by test prep (scatter with trend lines)

**Chart:** Scatter plot (X: reading score, Y: math score) with points colored by test preparation course and two best-fit lines (one per group). Legend shows the two groups and each group’s n.

**Interpretation:**

There is a positive correlation between math scores and reading scores in the scatterplot. Students that received test preparation scored higher in math as well as reading, and are grouped closely together. Students who did not receive test preparation scored lower in a more scattered pattern. It is apparent that higher scores are attained when test preparation is done, which is characterized by the trend lines indicating that higher scores are attained. Math scores as well as reading scores are closely linked, with test preparation making a significant impact.

## Summary

All plots are exported as PNGs in **`reports/figures/`** (or Result folder, depending on configuration). From observations, it is seen that **performance is influenced by gender, test prep, and lunch type**, and **subjects are highly correlated**.
